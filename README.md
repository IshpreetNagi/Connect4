# Connect4
Developed a recreation of the iconic Connect4 game experienceable through a 2-player local co-op in the Java environment. It is easily played on the terminal and can be played against other players in local co-op, so you can play against your friends, family, peers, etc. I also engineered a rudimentary AI system capable of reading the player's moves and reacting accordingly to secure victory, enabling the game to be played against the computer. The AI, however, is rather smart, is aware of the board, and will make strategic moves to cut the player off when it sees you can win, and will go for the win when it sees it has a possible winning move. Moreover, I programmed through the use of critical OOP design principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism allowing for effective and simple code generation. As well as deploying the use of complex programming techniques such as exception handling to allow for code program robustness.

If you encounter any bugs or problems with the game and its code, please feel free the reach out to me at: ishpreetnagi@gmail.com. Have fun!
