# Connect4
This is a java based Connect4 game! It is easily played on the terminal, and can be played against other players in local co-op, so you can play aginst your friends, family, peers, etc. or showdown against your own computer by playing against the in built AI and seeing if you can beat it. The AI, however, is rather smart, is aware of the board and will make strategic moves to cut the player off when it sees you can win, and will mgo for the win when it see's it has a possible wining move. If you encounter any bugs or problems with the game and its code, please feel free the reach out to me at: ishpreetnagi@gmail.com. Have fun!
